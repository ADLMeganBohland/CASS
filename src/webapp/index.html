            <p>CASS, which stands for Competencies and Skills System, is a collection of services and tools that can be used to define, store, manage, and access competencies and records of the competencies that an individual holds. CASS is intended to provide several basic services that are needed to implement competency-based education, training, and workforce development programs.</p>
            <p>The Framework Manager is the tool for viewing, creating, and managing competencies and competency frameworks.</p>
            <a class="button large" href="cass.example/framework.html">Enter the Framework Manager</a>
            <p>By providing a consistent and persistent way to reference a given competency, CASS will enable learning management systems, HR systems, learning record stores, talent management systems, and student information systems to produce competency-based credentials and transcripts that can be properly interpreted by any organization.</p>
            <p>The Profile Manager provides the basic means to create, connect, and view a user's competency profile.</p>
            <a class="button large" href="cass.example/profile.html">Enter the Profile Manager</a>
            <p>By providing records and evidence of a learner’s competencies in a secure manner that protects the learner’s privacy, CASS will enable learning activities to be tailored to the needs and capabilities of a learner, and by enabling learning resources to be tagged with machine-readable versions of competencies, CASS will facilitate the discovery and selection of resources that can help achieve a learning goal.</p>
            <p>The Resource Aligner demonstrates the workflow used to align resources to competencies in a connected world.</p>
